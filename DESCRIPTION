Description: Computes the random forest variable importance (VIMP) for the conditional random forest (cforest) of the 'party' package. Includes a function (varImp) that computes the VIMP for arbitrary measures from the 'measures' package. For calculating the VIMP regarding the measures accuracy and auc two extra functions exist (varImpAUC and varImpACC).
